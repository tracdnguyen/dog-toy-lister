Doy Toy Lister is a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app made to help you keep track of all dog's favorite toys! Run 'bundle install' to install all gems. Run 'shotgun' to start your local server and copy paste your server location into your browser. You may create an account, view toys posted by other users, add your own toys, and edit/delete a toy made by the same user.
